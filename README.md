# Munchkin Counter for Firefox OS (or any modern browser on a touch device)

This is a helper app for players of the popular card adventure game [Munchkin](http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/). 
In Munchkin you explore a dungeon by opening doors, and killing and looting whatever monster is inside (provided your friends don't stab you in the back to steal your stuff). 
Killing monsters grants you levels and phat loot.

This app helps you keep track of your character's total power. On the Battle page you can easily calculate whether you will become victorious in glorious combat, or fail miserably. 
'Cause warriors don't need math! 

Give your Munchkin a proper name and, if you are on Firefox OS, touch the profile image to use a picture from your camera or gallery for that extra touch of personality!

This app was based on Jaxo/fxosstub, available [here](https://github.com/Jaxo/fxosstub). 

The app makes use of several vector graphics that have been released to the public domain, listed in img-pd/README.txt.
